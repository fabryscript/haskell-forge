# Haskell Forge

Hey there! Welcome to the **Haskell Forge**, my personal lab where I learn haskell by getting my hands dirty and having fun!

## Wait, why are you even doing this?

Memes aside, I've always heard positive things about this language in terms of enhancing a developer's problem solving skills and I've always wanted to try and see how it feels to switch from an Imperative style of programming (yes, I'm talking to you, JavaScript) to a purely functional, declarative and strictly typed language. Also, I love lambdas!

## How to understand this repo

Most of the exercises that I do are given by myself (yes, I literally challenge myself) and I'm using [this YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgu82wiiZ90&list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV) about learning Haskell for Imperative programmers.

Also, I will be doing Exercism exercises and publishing them here when I'm feeling ready and I finally have a good grasp of the language.

## Final takes

Well, that's all folks, _I really hope that monads won't take my mental sanity away...(sigh)_

Happy coding! ðŸ’œ
